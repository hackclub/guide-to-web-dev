The Hack Club's Guide to Web Development:

There are different approaches on getting started with coding, so the purpose of this guide is to share the Hack Club way on how to learn to code.

I hope everyone who reads this guide finds it as helpful as it was for me writing it. 

> "Learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a consumer to a creator. Suddenly, computers become a tool for creating."
